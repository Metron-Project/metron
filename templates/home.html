          <strong>Metron</strong>
          is a community-based site whose goal is to build an open database with a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> API for comics.
        </h2>

        <h1 class="title is-5">Why?</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle is-6">
          Currently the only comic book database the provides a REST API for users is
          <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/">Comic Vine</a>.
          Unfortunately, since it's a corporately-owned service, the community that uses it has no control
          over the amount of resources provided to maintain it or ensure it's continued accessibility.

        <h1 class="title is-5">Want to join?</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle is-6">
          Currently, the site is under heavy construction but I'll be opening up registration and adding some
          documentation fairly soon.

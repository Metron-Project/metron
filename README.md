# Metron

A commmunity created comicbook database.


## 🤔 <a href="motivation">Motivation</a>
Currently the only comic book database the provides a REST API for users is <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/">Comic Vine</a>. Unfortunately, since it's a corporately-owned service, the community that uses it has no control over the amount of resources provided to maintain it or ensure it's continued accessibility. So, I started Metron as an alternative to Comic Vine and as an educational exercise.

## 👍🏻 <a href="alternative">Alternatives</a>
The project is fairly new compared to the other databases, so it might not meet your needs. Some alternatives include:

* [Grand Comics Database (GCD)](https://www.comics.org/) - Large database, that unfortunately doesn't provide an API.
* [League of Comic Greeks](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/) - Has an API that is only available to retailers, and they seem to have zero interest in opening access to their community.
* [Comic Vine](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/) - Publicly available API.

Metron is just a little side project I'm toying with to provide a commmunity comicbook database (like the ComicDB,
Grand Comics Database, or Comic Vine). Currently, Comic Vine is the only the service that provides a REST api, but
it seems they've reduced the team that works on it's backend (and that it's a corporate-owned service causes some
concern regarding it's future). Anyway, if you're interested in this, you can visit it at https://metron.cloud/

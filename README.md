# Metron

A community created comic-book database.

## 🤔 <a href="motivation">Motivation</a>

Currently, the only comic book database the provides a REST API for users is <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/">
Comic Vine</a>. Unfortunately, since it's a corporately-owned service, the community that uses it has no control over
the amount of resources provided to maintain it or ensure it's continued accessibility. So, I started Metron as an
alternative to Comic Vine and as an educational exercise.

## 👍🏻 <a href="alternative">Alternatives</a>

The project is fairly new compared to the other databases, so it might not meet your needs. Some alternatives include:

* [Grand Comics Database (GCD)](https://www.comics.org/) - Large database, that unfortunately doesn't provide an API.
* [League of Comic Greeks](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/) - Has an API that is only available to retailers, and they
  seem to have zero interest in opening access to their community.
* [Comic Vine](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/) - Publicly available API.
